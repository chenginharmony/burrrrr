When you create new events, everyone must receive the Notification live "@Userhave just created a new event. Join now!" - theere must be a "Creating Event, please wait" small loaoding modal while the event is being created (we dont want a static blank screen while a nnew event is bwing created) - Header is msiing on mobikle view - Mobile footer nav menu icons are missing as well. - Wallet menu will/is already on the Header as a small btton menu so remove it from the moebile menu bar and replace it with the Profile page menu icon (which is the avatar of the current user) - menus on mobile are arrange dlike this (Events | Games | Create | History | Profile)
